Welcome! This site is a work in progress, I hope to develop it a little more in the future.

Short Bio
----

I am a physicist and applied mathematician transitioning into the field of nutritional science. I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes during my time at university, leading to a new-found interest in nutrition and metabolic health. I am currently working towards a PhD that combines my physics background with my interest in human nutrition in the area of nutritional neuroimaging. In particular I am interested in sweet taste sensing and how this is both linked to and altered by metabolic disorders such as Type 2 Diabetes and obesity.
