Welcome! This site is a work in progress, I hope to develop it a little more in the future.

Short Bio
----

I am a physicist and applied mathematician transitioning into the field of nutritional science. I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes during my time at university, leading to a new-found interest in nutrition and metabolic health. I am currently working towards a PhD in the area of sweet taste sensing and how this is altered by metabolic disorders such as Type 2 Diabetes.
